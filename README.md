# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

Maria, a schoolboard stakeholder, has asked us to prepare her code using Jupyter notebook that will allow her to analyze 15 schools and their key metrics such as sums, averages, and percentages related to math and reading test scores. These metrics were compared to school size, budget, and type. To further meticulate the data, we compared scores by grade level. Thus, from our code, we were tasked with producing various reports: District Summary, School Summary,  
The original dataset used to develop our code is schools_complete.csv adn students_complete.csv. The data was inspected and cleaned before our analysis to minimize any discrepancies and make any necessary corrections to malformed data, such as removing prefixes to student names to align with school record documentation. The programming language we used was Python. Specifically, the PythonData environment was used within Jupyter notebook coupled with Pandas library to help prepare our analysis.
